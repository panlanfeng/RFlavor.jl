This package provides several handful R functions in Julia.
The aim is to make a better life for users familiar with R but not to be a translation of R base functions. So functions could be similar but may not be exactly the same.

Naming tradition:
* The dot "." in R functions will be replaced by underscore "\_"
* Functions will be lower cases to follow Julia tradition

This package is still under development. All feature requests and comments are welcome.
